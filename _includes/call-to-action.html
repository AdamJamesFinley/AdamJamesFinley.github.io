                <p class="text-faded">I completed my PhD at the University of Exeter in May 2020, as part of the <a href="http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/AWESoMeStars/" ><font color='black'>AWESoMeStars ERC project</font></a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ou.edu/cas/physics-astronomy/people/directory/faculty/sean-matt" ><font color='black'>Prof. Sean Matt</font></a>. I continued working with Prof. Sean Matt in Exeter as a Postdoctoral Research Associate until December 2020. Since then, I have been employed as a Postdoctoral Researcher at CEA Paris-Saclay with <a href="http://irfu.cea.fr/Phocea/Membres/Annuaire/index.php?uid=asbrun" ><font color='black'>Prof. Sacha Brun</font></a>, as part of the <a href="http://wholesun.eu/" ><font color='black'>WholeSun ERC project</font></a>. In November I will begin a research fellowship at the <a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2025/05/Research_Fellows_in_space_science_2025" ><font color='black'>European Space Agency</font></a> (ESTEC).</p>

                <p class="text-faded">My research focuses on the atmospheres of stars like the Sun, which are heated to millions of degrees and subsequently escape in the form of stellar winds. During my PhD, I investigated how these winds remove angular momentum from Sun-like stars using a combination of numerical models and observations. I found that even for our closest star (the Sun) measuring the loss of angular momentum (how quickly the Sun's rotation is slowing down) posed many challenges, and so I placed constraints on the solar wind angular momentum flux and the rotation of the Sun’s atmosphere. Now, as part of the WholeSun project, I investigate the heating of the solar atmosphere and the generation of magnetic flux inside Sun-like stars with numerical simulations. I am also interested in long-term trends in the Sun’s magnetic activity, from the formation of active region nests to the role of coronal holes in sculpting the solar wind. Some of my time is devoted to following the Sun’s flaring activity and producing weekly bulletins that are widely distributed. </p>
