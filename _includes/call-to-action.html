                <p class="text-faded">I completed my PhD at the University of Exeter in May 2020, as part of the AWESoMeStars ERC project under the supervision of Prof. Sean Matt. Afterwards, I continued working with Prof. Sean Matt in Exeter as a Postdoctoral Research Associate until December 2020. From then, I started a Postdoctoral Research position at CEA Paris-Saclay with Prof. Sacha Brun, as part of the WHOLESUN ERC project. </p>

                <p class="text-faded">My research interests are centered around modelling and understanding the interaction of stellar atmospheres/winds and the dynamo-driven magnetic fields found in most low-mass stars like the Sun. The Sun's magnetised wind (the solar wind), like that of many other Sun-like and low-mass stars, removes angular momentum from its surface, which causes the Sun's rotation period to gradually increase over billions of years. This process is similar for most low-mass stars, and so by studing the solar wind it is possible for us to gain insights that are broadly applicable to other stars.</p>
