                <p class="text-faded">I completed my PhD at the University of Exeter in May 2020, as part of the <a href="http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/AWESoMeStars/" ><font color='black'>AWESoMeStars ERC project</font></a> under the supervision of <a href="https://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/staff/sm561" ><font color='black'>Prof. Sean Matt</font></a>. I continued working with Prof. Sean Matt in Exeter as a Postdoctoral Research Associate until December 2020. Since then, I have been emplyed as a Postdoctoral Researcher at CEA Paris-Saclay with <a href="http://irfu.cea.fr/Phocea/Membres/Annuaire/index.php?uid=asbrun" ><font color='black'>Prof. Sacha Brun</font></a>, as part of the <a href="http://wholesun.eu/" ><font color='black'>WholeSun ERC project</font></a>. </p>

                <p class="text-faded">My research focuses on the atmospheres of stars like the Sun, which are heated to millions of degrees and subsequently escape in the form of stellar winds. During my PhD, I investigated how these winds remove angular momentum from Sun-like stars using a combination of numerical models and observations. However, I quickly learnt that even for our closest star (the Sun) measuing the loss of angular momentum (how quickly the Sun's rotation is slowing down) is challenging… so I placed constraints by evaluating the solar wind angular momentum flux and the rotation of the Sun’s atmosphere. Now, as part of the WholeSun project, I am investigating the heating of the solar atmosphere and the generation of magnetic flux inside Sun-like stars, using numerical simulations. I have also been assessing long-term trends in the Sun’s magnetic activity, from persistent active longitudes to the role of coronal holes in sculpting the solar wind. Some of my time is devoted to following the Sun’s flaring activity, and producing weekly bulletins that are widely distributed. </p>
