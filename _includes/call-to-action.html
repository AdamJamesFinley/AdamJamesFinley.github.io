                <p class="text-faded">I completed my PhD at the University of Exeter in May 2020, as part of the AWESoMeStars ERC project under the supervision of Prof. Sean Matt. Afterwards, I continued working with Prof. Sean Matt in Exeter as a Postdoctoral Research Associate until December 2020. From then onwards, I have been working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at CEA Paris-Saclay with Prof. Sacha Brun, as part of the WHOLESUN ERC project. </p>

                <p class="text-faded">My research interests are centered around the interaction of stellar atmospheres/winds and the dynamo-driven magnetic fields found in most low-mass stars like the Sun. I typically investigate these processes using a combination of magnetohydrodynamic models and observations of the Sun (and other Sun-like stars). Throughout my PhD I investigated how magnetised stellar winds remove angular momentum from stars like the Sun. This process is clearly visible when looking at trends in the rotation periods of Sun-like (and low-mass) stars at different ages. As this process is similar for most low-mass stars, by studing how the solar wind removes angular momentum from the Sun, we can gain insights into this process which are broadly applicable to other stars. My postdoctoral research looks in more detail at the energetics of the solar atmopshere, from which the solar wind in launched.</p>
