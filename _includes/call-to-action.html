                <p class="text-faded">I completed my PhD at the University of Exeter in May 2020, as part of the <a href="http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/AWESoMeStars/" ><font color='black'>AWESoMeStars ERC project</font></a> under the supervision of <a href="https://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/staff/sm561" ><font color='black'>Prof. Sean Matt</font></a>. Afterwards, I continued working with Prof. Sean Matt in Exeter as a Postdoctoral Research Associate until December 2020. From then onwards, I have been working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at CEA Paris-Saclay with <a href="http://irfu.cea.fr/Phocea/Membres/Annuaire/index.php?uid=asbrun" ><font color='black'>Prof. Sacha Brun</font></a>, as part of the <a href="http://wholesun.eu/" ><font color='black'>WHOLESUN ERC project</font></a>. </p>

                <p class="text-faded">My research interests center around the atmospheres of low-mass stars like the Sun, which are heated to millions of degrees by magnetohydrodynamic processes and subsequently driven to escape in the form of stellar winds. I investigate these processes using a combination of magnetohydrodynamic models and observations. During my PhD I investigated how magnetised stellar winds remove angular momentum from stars like the Sun. This process is clearly visible in the trends of rotation periods of Sun-like (and low-mass) stars at different ages. As this process is similar for most low-mass stars, by studing how the solar wind removes angular momentum from the Sun, we can gain insights that are broadly applicable to other stars. My postdoctoral research aims to further understand how the solar atmopshere is heated, from which the solar wind in launched, and ultimately connect this to the atmospheres of other low-mass stars.</p>
