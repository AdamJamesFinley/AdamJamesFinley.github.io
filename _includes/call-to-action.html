                <p class="text-faded">I completed my PhD at the University of Exeter in May 2020, as part of the <a href="http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/AWESoMeStars/" ><font color='black'>AWESoMeStars ERC project</font></a> under the supervision of <a href="https://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/staff/sm561" ><font color='black'>Prof. Sean Matt</font></a>. Afterwards, I continued working with Prof. Sean Matt in Exeter as a Postdoctoral Research Associate until December 2020. From then onwards, I have been working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at CEA Paris-Saclay with <a href="http://irfu.cea.fr/Phocea/Membres/Annuaire/index.php?uid=asbrun" ><font color='black'>Prof. Sacha Brun</font></a>, as part of the <a href="http://wholesun.eu/" ><font color='black'>WHOLESUN ERC project</font></a>. </p>

                <p class="text-faded"><a><a><font color='black'> My research</font></a> focuses on the atmospheres of stars like the Sun, which are heated to millions of degrees by magnetohydrodynamic processes and subsequently escape in the form of <a><font color='black'> stellar winds</font></a>. During my PhD I investigated how these winds <a><font color='black'> remove angular momentum</font></a> from Sun-like stars using a combination of numerical models and observations. However there remain fundamental challenges in measuring this even for our closest star… Since then, my research has focused more on quantifying the <a><font color='black'> angular momentum loss rate of the Sun</font></a>, and better understanding the <a><font color='black'> rotation of the Sun’s atmosphere</font></a>. As part of the WholeSun project, I am also investigating the <a><font color='black'> heating of the solar atmosphere</font></a>, and the <a><font color='black'> generation of magnetic flux</font></a> inside Sun-like stars. I am also interested by <a><font color='black'> long-term trends</font></a>in the Sun’s behavior, be it the persistence of active longitudes or the role of coronal holes in sculpting structure in the solar wind. Part of my time is also devoted to <a><font color='black'> following the Sun’s activity</font></a>, and producing weekly bulletins that are widely distributed. </p>
