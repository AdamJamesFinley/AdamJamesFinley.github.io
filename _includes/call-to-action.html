                <p class="text-faded">I completed my PhD at the University of Exeter in May 2020, as part of the <a href="http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/AWESoMeStars/" ><font color='black'>AWESoMeStars ERC project</font></a> under the supervision of <a href="https://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/staff/sm561" ><font color='black'>Prof. Sean Matt</font></a>. Afterwards, I continued working with Prof. Sean Matt in Exeter as a Postdoctoral Research Associate until December 2020. From then onwards, I have been working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at CEA Paris-Saclay with <a href="http://irfu.cea.fr/Phocea/Membres/Annuaire/index.php?uid=asbrun" ><font color='black'>Prof. Sacha Brun</font></a>, as part of the <a href="http://wholesun.eu/" ><font color='black'>WHOLESUN ERC project</font></a>. </p>

                <p class="text-faded">I study the atmospheres of stars like the Sun which are heated to millions of degrees by magnetohydrodynamic processes and subsequently escape in the form of stellar winds. During my PhD I investigated how these winds remove angular momentum from Sun-like stars using a combination of numerical models and observations. This process is clearly visible in the trends of rotation periods of low-mass stars at different ages. My postdoctoral research aims to better understand how the solar atmopshere is heated (which drives the solar wind), and ultimately understand this process in the more broader context of other low-mass stars.</p>
