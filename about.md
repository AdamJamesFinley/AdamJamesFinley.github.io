I wish to understand the complex interaction of stellar magnetic fields and plasma in stellar winds and other astrophysical fluids. The Sun is seen to undergo a 22 year cycle of magnetic activity, over which time the overall dipolar field structure is seen to reverse and then be restored. Through the use of Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) observations, other sun-like stars have been seen to have cyclic variability in their magnetic activity. This modified field topology is believed to impact the spin-down forces on the star, and thus effect predictions for the age of the star (Gyrochronology).

Working in the [AWESoMeStars](http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/AWESoMeStars/) research group, supervised by [Sean Matt](http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/staff/sm561), I create magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of stellar winds from sun-like stars, where I explore the impact of imposed magnetic field structures on the morphology and structure within the wind. My research is mainly focused on the creation of torque scaling laws for evolutionary models of stellar spin down, which take into account the changing magnetic field structure seen in many active stars. I have performed a systematic study of the simplest axisymmetric field combinations, dipole, quadrupole and octupole, producing semi-analytic relations for the torque on the star. I have subsequently applied these to the variable magnetic field topologies observed in both the Sun and other sun-like stars. I am furthering this work by concidering more complex/realistic magnetic field configurations in my MHD wind simulations.

To better visualise the magnetic fields of solar-like stars (and potentially other magnetised astrophysical phenomena), I have been working with the physics department's 3D printing capability to render handheld models which can be used for research or outreach purposes.
